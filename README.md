AI-Powered Technical Interview Simulator
Overview
This project is an AI-powered technical interview simulator designed to conduct a real-time, voice-based interview with automatic scoring and feedback. It evaluates candidates' responses to a series of technical questions from pre-defined datasets. The system uses natural language processing models and machine learning algorithms to analyze, score, and provide feedback for each answer in real-time. The interview includes questions with varying difficulty levels, and candidates can respond verbally. The system checks for content correctness, paraphrasing, and exact matches and provides detailed feedback on performance.

->Features
Voice-based Interview Simulation: Uses speech recognition to accept verbal answers to technical questions.
Real-time Feedback: Provides instant feedback based on correctness, paraphrasing, and content relevance.
AI-Powered Scoring: Utilizes pre-trained models to calculate the similarity between the candidate’s answer and the expected answer.
Question Pool by Difficulty: Allows selecting questions from different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
Final Performance Evaluation: Generates a summary of the candidate's performance with scores, precision, recall, and F1 metrics.
Text-to-Speech Output: Reads questions aloud to the user for a more interactive experience.
->Technologies Used
Python: Core language for development.
SpeechRecognition: For converting spoken responses into text.
pyttsx3: Text-to-Speech engine to read questions aloud.
Transformers (Hugging Face):
RobertaForSequenceClassification: Used for classifying the correctness of answers.
GPTNeoForCausalLM: GPT-based language model to evaluate and generate responses.
SentenceTransformers: For checking paraphrasing and semantic similarity.
Pandas: For handling the datasets of questions and answers.
Keyboard: To trigger user responses.
Machine Learning Evaluation:
f1_score, precision_score, and recall_score to evaluate the quality of answers.

->Setup Instructions
Download Pre-trained Models
Ensure that you have access to the necessary pre-trained models by downloading them from the Hugging Face model hub. The following models are required:

RobertaForSequenceClassification: roberta-base
GPTNeoForCausalLM: EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B
SentenceTransformer: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
These will automatically be downloaded during the first run.
Set Up Microphone for Voice Input
Make sure your system's microphone is properly set up for the speech recognition feature.
->Models and Functionalities
1. RobertaForSequenceClassification
Used to classify whether the candidate's answer is correct or not.
Fine-tuned on a classification task to evaluate text responses.
2. GPTNeoForCausalLM
Utilized for language generation and evaluating the fluency of responses.
Can be extended to provide auto-generated model-based answers for comparison.
3. Sentence-BERT (SBERT)
Used to compute semantic similarity between the question and the answer.
The model generates embeddings for both the question and answer, and the cosine similarity between them is calculated.
->Feedback Mechanism
The system evaluates the candidate’s answers based on the following criteria:

Exact Match: If the candidate’s answer exactly matches the question, the system identifies it as invalid.
Paraphrasing: If the answer is too similar to the question, it’s identified as a paraphrase.
Content Correctness: The system checks if the key concepts or information is present in the answer.
Minimum Word Count: Ensures that the answer has a sufficient length (default minimum of 10 words).
Feedback is provided in real-time after each question, and a final feedback report is given at the end of the interview.
->Performance Metrics
At the end of the interview, the following metrics are calculated to evaluate the overall performance:

F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving a balanced view of performance.
Precision: The number of true positives divided by the total number of positive predictions.
Recall: The number of true positives divided by the total number of actual positives.
